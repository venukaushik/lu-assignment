  <header>Top 10 best hypercars 2022</header>
<div class="info">
  <p>Only the fastest, most expensive and ludicrous-looking cars need apply to make our top ten hypercars list. Find out
    which we rate the highest</p><br>
  <b>The very peak of automotive performance and the very fastest, most expensive and most powerful four-wheel
    achievements in the world are represented in our hypercars top ten.</b><br>
  <p>If it has set a production-car speed record lately or taken us into uncharted territory on ask-and-you-can’t-afford
    showroom price or peak power output, chances are you’ll find it here.
    Some of this class’s entrants have state-of-the-art hybrid-electric powertrains, others just savagely fierce
    combustion motors ready to hurl them into the middle distance. But all are monuments to both the science and the
    thrill of out speed.</p></div>
    <div class="cars">
    <p>Hypercars are among the most powerful, fastest and rarest vehicles on the roads. Not too long ago, supercars were the most desirable machines on four wheels, but competition among manufacturers to build the fastest and most expensive driving machine culminated in a new breed of hyper-exotic performance cars that took on the hypercar name. Here, we’re picking out the ten best hypercars ever built.Supercars are impressive feats of engineering, but they don’t come close to the performance of the most powerful hypercars. Don’t be surprised if a hypercar promises double or even triple the power of what we currently think of as a supercar, as it's not uncommon to see these exotic machines produce power figures way over 1,000bhp. Hypercars often feature technology derived from the top tiers of motorsport, with the likes of Ferrari and Mercedes-AMG implementing genuine Formula 1 racing components and the prices being asked reflect this. The hypercar car class is where manufacturers try to outdo each other with money-no-object creations that are only within reach for a select group of buyers.</p>

      <p>Ferrari’s latest top-of-the-tree hypercar is nothing less than the greatest and most sensational peak that the
        performance car has ever reached. Powered by an incredible, spine-tingling, naturally aspirated, 789bhp
        6.3-litre V12 assisted by 161bhp of electric power channelled direct to the rear wheels, the LaFerrari’s
        powertrain makes an incredible 950bhp all told.</p>

      <div class="card">McLaren P1</div>
      <p>McLaren Automotive’s first ‘Ultimate Series’ car had to follow in the footsteps of the firm’s legendary and
        celebrated F1, which built the company a worldwide reputation all by itself. McLaren resisted the temptation to
        make the P1 a modern facsimile of the F1, however, instead having a 903bhp hybrid-electric powertrain, a
        two-seat interior, state-of-the-art suspension technology.</p>

      <p>When McLaren adopted the name of its most revered and tragically fated F1 racing driver to use as the model
        identity of its latest 'ultimate series' hypercar, a sharp intake of breath was taken throughout the motorsport
        world and the car industry alike.The Senna is a car of truly astonishing track abilities. Even though its not
        the most powerful car to have lapped our dry handling circuit</p>

      <p>Electric hypercars will always be contentious when they’re competing with the very high-revving, noisiest,
        fastest and most dramatic combustion-engined performance cars in the world, but they are undoubtedly in the
        process of taking this niche by the force of instant, walloping, vectored-per-corner torque. And the only
        example we’ve yet to do any more than ride in is the awesome Lotus Evija.</p>

      <p>The Volkswagen Group’s trophy brand, Bugatti, made history when it gave us the fastest production car in the
        world in 2005. The W16-engined, 987bhp, four-wheel-drive Veyron broke through the 250mph barrier. But it
        couldn’t and wouldn’t be regarded as the ultimate performance car forever.Where the Veyron stopped short of
        1200bhp in its final forms, the Chiron ups that to nearly 1500.</p>

      <p>Carrying heavier and more powerful electric motors and more battery capacity than either of its hypercar
        competitors from Ferrari or McLaren, the Porsche 918 Spyder made greater play of its 21st-century zero-emissions
        technology than its rivals and had a breadth of appeal as a driver’s car that neither could quite level
        with.There's four-wheel drive.</p>

      <div class="card">Koenigsegg One:1</div>
      <p>Numbers speak volumes when it comes to describing the quickest thing yet to come out of Ängelholm, Sweden that
        doesn’t have jet engines and air-to-air missiles. The Koenigsegg One:1 costs £2 million. Its turbocharged,
        ethanol-fuelled V8 develops more than 1300bhp. In the right conditions, claims its maker, it’s capable of
        cracking 250mph from rest in less than 20sec.</p>

      <p>When hypercars get excessive, they do it with some style – and the Aston Martin Vulcan is certainly excessive.
        This 820bhp, track-only, carbon-tubbed hypercar, built from a chassis and engine adapted from that of the Aston
        Martin One-77, produces 118dB of exhaust noise: enough, by a long way, to earn it an immediate black flag on
        almost any track day in the UK.</p>

      <p>Pagani is a maker of cars so rare and exotic that it once offered leather driving accessories that had been
        blessed by the Bishop of Rome himself – or so the story goes.The Modenese firm’s latest offering is the Huayra,
        introduced in 2012, back when 720bhp and 738lb ft seemed like a faintly ludicrous amounts of power and torque to
        try to put through one driven axle in a road car.</p>

      <p>Take one Lamborghini Aventador supercar. Turn the wick up on its 6.5-litre V12 engine to unprecedented heights,
        give it show-stopping naked carbonfibre bodywork good for greater aerodynamic efficiency than any
        series-production Lamborghini, christen it in honour of the 100th anniversary of company founder Ferruccio
        Lamborghini’s birth, and bingo, you have the Centenario.</p>
